Hello, to everyone and thank you for your presence. I am 18 years old and I love security and things about it. This site has long codes and many hardworking hours to complete.
The scripts I will be presenting are in python and hardly ever on bat, or C#.
Have fun and also these codes are homemade, so don't suspect any type of virus or ransamware, since the codes are scanned by Github itself.
Some codes will need some changes from you (file specifying and other small changes).
if you think it has some kind of virus then run the scripts in a virtual machine.
Thanks for your patience.
